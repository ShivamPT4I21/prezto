Prezto â€” Instantly Awesome Zsh
==============================

[Prezto][2] is the configuration framework for [Zsh][1]; it enriches the command line
interface environment with sane defaults, aliases, functions, auto completion,
and prompt themes.

This repository comes with three enhanced themes: *Budspencer*, *Terencehill* and
*Dangerous*.

Advanced features
-----------------

  * Clear indication of active mode (INSERT=yellow, NORMAL=blue, REPLACE=red)
  * Additional indicators for:
      - active background jobs
      - RANGER_LEVEL environment variable
      - runtime of last command
      - superuser
  * Advanced path display:
      - none (don't show)
      - truncated (show truncated path)
      - complete (show complete path)
  * Toggle path display by:

        Ctrl+Space in INSERT/REPLACE mode
        Space in NORMAL mode

  * Configure path display, example toggles between *none* and *complete*:

        export PWDFORMAT="none complete"
